# Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of interpreting data in the form of graphs and charts so that it is easier to consume and understand the data.

## Why do we use data visualization?
Data in its raw form is messy and hard to understand by the user. So to make the data visually presented in a right manner to get interpreted easily by the user, data visualization comes into play.
