# Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of interpreting data in the form of graphs and charts so that it is easier to consume and understand the data.

## Why do we use data visualization?
Data in its raw form is messy and hard to understand by the user. So to make the data visually presented in a right manner to get interpreted easily by the user, data visualization comes into play.

## What are the types of data visualization?
The most common data visualization tools are: 
1. Scatter Plots
2. Bar Charts
3. Heat Maps
4. Line Graphs
5. Pie Charts
6. Area Charts
7. Choropleth Maps
8. Histograms
