# Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of interpreting data in the form of graphs and charts so that it is easier to consume and understand the data.

> _Data comprises a collection of numerical values recording the magnitudes of various attributes of the objects under study._

## Why do we use data visualization?
Data in its raw form is messy and hard to understand by the user. So to make the data visually presented in a right manner to get interpreted easily by the user, data visualization comes into play.

## What are the types of data visualization?
The most common data visualization types are: 
1. Scatter Plots
2. Bar Charts
3. Heat Maps
4. Line Graphs
5. Pie Charts
6. Area Charts
7. Choropleth Maps
8. Histograms
9. Box Plot


## General Type of visualizations:
1. **Charts:** _Infromation present in a tabular, graphical form with data displayed along two axes. Can be in the form of graph, diagram, maps._
2. **Table:** _A set of figures dispalyed in rows and columns._
3. **Graph:** _A diagram of points, lines, segments, curves or areas that represent certain variables in comparison to each other, usually along two axes at a right angle._
4. **Geospatial:** _A visualization that shows data in map from using different shapes and colors to show the relationship between the pieces of data and specific location._
5. **Infographic:** _A combination of visuals and words that represent data. Usually uses charts or diagrams._
6. **Dashboards:** _A collection of visualization and data displayed in one place to help with analyzing and presenting data._
